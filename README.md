PET-GEN NAME GENERATOR

Project Description: 
This application will exist to help website users in the selection process of a pet name. By combining multiple lists of pre-existing pet names, the user will be able to answer questions to a short quiz to help the random generator deploy more accurate name suggestions. The application will handle the parsing out of these lists depending on user input to quiz questions. These questions will range from things like pet gender to pet behavior. 
The final result of the application should be a small list of 1-5 unique names based on one's questions in the quiz. Therefore this application will provide some resolve to users who are indecisive when it comes to naming their pets. This application can also be used for more than naming real-life pets, it can also be used in creative writing projects or for virtual companions in RPG-like settings.   

Project Architecture:
The designated name generating program will be almost entirely web-based, using web development tools such as HTML and CSS to create the website. Since this will be a very front-end-heavy project, we intend to focus mostly on getting the most out of our HTML, making a sleek, simple, accessible user interface for answering questions relating to the pet name. We will likely be using Heroku as our hosting service. On the backend, we will primarily be using Javascript to store our names, inputs, as well as other systems that will utilize a particular set of variables that need to be stored. For our server, weâ€™ll likely use node.js. Node.js will allow us to take advantage of server-side scripting, and provide communication between the client and server, permitting us to use javascript answer storage and the algorithm for name generation.
